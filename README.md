# Workspace
Hello and welcome to my humble repository!

First and foremost, I would like to state that this repository mainly serves the purpose of maintaining a well-organized and safe workplace environment for all my present and future projects. This means that it comprises mostly of TeX documents and design project files but also of some microcontroller code, C programs and many more interesting examples of challenges I had the opportunity to approach during my studies on FEE CTU in Prague.

Personal introduction TO-DO :)
