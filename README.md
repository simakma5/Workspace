# Workspace
Hello and welcome to my humble repository!

First and foremost, I would like to state that this repository mainly serves the selfish purpose of maintaining a well-organized and safe workplace environment for my present and future projects. That means it comprises mostly of TeX documents and design project files but also of some microcontroller code, other C programs and many more examples of challenges I have the opportunity to approach during my studies at FEE CTU in Prague.

Rest of introduction TO-DO :)
