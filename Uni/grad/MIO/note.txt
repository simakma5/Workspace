- In stripline implementation using matlab, there was a discrepancy in 2022a where the overall dielectric thickness was automatically doubled (e.g., I'd put just 0.508 instead of 1.016)
- Generally, for coupled lines, striplines are better than microstrip lines. They're capable of higher coupling and don't suffer from dispersion as much.
- Coupled striplines: decresing gap increases the difference between odd and even mode impedances. When I wanna just move them (leave the difference), I need to modify the strip's widths disproportionaly, I think.
- Electric length greatly increases frequency dependence of S-parameters I think.
- Becuase the effective permitivity of the stripline (coupled stripline as well) designed in the seminar is the same, both the odd and even mode electric lengths are the same?
- Electric length is mainly changed (disproportionally) by the relative permitivity, whereas the width is mainly changed (proportionally) by the (?dielectric?) thickness h.
- When I have data of a transistor (touchstone file .s2p) and I import it into AWR, I get something. Then, when I create a subcircuit with it, connect it to two ports and I view the graphs in one picture, the directly-imported one (definitely correct) and the subscircuit one differ. That is most probably because the data in the touchstone file is rough (small freq step) and the characteristic is then interpolated in AWR. The thing is that from default, AWR uses Cartesian coordinates for interpolation but the s-parameters contained in the touchstone files are better interpolated using polar coordinates. That can be adjusted in Options->Project Options->Interpolation/Passivity->Coordinate System. We can also tweak/adjust the interpolation method if desired.
- Impedance transformer: port A 50 Ohm, port B 100 Ohm. What do? I connect it with a microstrip line of lambda/4 wavelength (impedance transformer only works on a specific design frequency) of impedance sqrt(50*100). That's it, bidirectionally matched (I/O & O/I).
