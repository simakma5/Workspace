Version 1.0 First Version
Version 1.01 clarifictaion about dimensions and coordinate
             frame used ( ECI ) 
             
The COE ( Classical Orbital Elements ) tool will help to
visualize orbital elements around a planet and is intended
as a help to experiment with the different oribtal elements
and see how the orbit will look like.

The orbit color is as follows
blue: prograde
red: retrograde
black: polar

The coordinate frame is ECI ( Earth Centered Inertial )
where the X-axis is pointing towards vernal equinox.

The X-axis has the point colored black
The Y-axis has the point colored blue
The Z-axis has the point colored red

The ascending node vector is in the equatorial plane
colored green.

When you plot an orbit the graphic window will automatically
be set to hold-off so to be able to plot 2 or more orbits
in the same window you have to press the hold-on button
in between every plot command.
